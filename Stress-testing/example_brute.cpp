// writing here is similar to writing inside solve() function so we will copy the code https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/61889412 as desrired 
        ll n;cin>>n; //notice we replaced int to ll as ll is defined in h1.h as long long int
       // cout<<digitSum(n)+n<<endl;

_2 //manadatory don't remove it !!
  
  //notice we have used _2 instead of _1 since we have one or more test cases to be tested
